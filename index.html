    <h2> Personal Information </h2>
    <p> Welcome to my profile! My name is Seah Soon Kitz (s3665432) and you can contact me through my email at Nickseah0921@gmail.com. I am a Malaysian Chinese who grew up in Malaysia, from where I am from, we have a diversity of cultures as Malaysia is a multi-racial country consisting of Chinese, Malays and Indians. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Business Management at RMIT University. I am able to speak four languages which are English, Malay, Chinese and Cantonese, it is a norm in my country to speak that many languages because there are many different races in Malaysia. A fun fact about myself is that I play the electric guitar, I have been playing the instrument for about 8 years now and I am in Grade 8 for the electric guitar exams. </p>  
    <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
    <p> What I find most interesting about IT is that how by integrating information technology into society, it can benefit and improve our everyday lives. For example, with Uber, any one is able to get a ride at any time and anywhere at their convenience through an application in their phone. My interest in IT started when I was developing gaming applications for the iOS at 14 years old. I have made around 6 games for the iPhone and iPad platform and made a good enough pocket money for myself. It was my father who persuaded me to start developing iOS applications as it was a growing trend back in the day. During that time, nobody taught me how to develop applications but rather I taught myself how to do so by watching many YouTube tutorials. It was a troublesome process but it was worth in the end as I was featured in our national newspaper for developing iOS applications. </p>
    
    <p> I chose to come to RMIT because it was recommended by my cousin who previously studied Finance at RMIT. He suggested that RMIT is an overall good university to further my studies in the Bachelor of Business. Other reasons I chose to come to RMIT is that it is convenient in terms of the short walking distance from where I live; this allows me to be on time for lectures and tutorials, and also the fact that the library is nearby for me to work on assignments or to study. </p>
    
    <p> In taking up the Bachelor of Business Management, I expect to further my knowledge in the field of business as I have to take over my parents’ advertising firm some time in the future. By taking up this course, I am hoping to learn how to run a business efficiently, how to deal and interact with my employees, how to apply the theories I have learned into real-world situations, and so on. </p>

    <h2> Ideal Job </h2>
    <img src = "Ideal_Job.png" width= "320">
    
    <p> Sun Protection Apparel Pty Ltd is looking a hire an individual that manages their online marketing as well as creating different graphic designs for their user interface. This position appealed to me as I am looking to venture into a job creativity and critical thinking. Both marketing and graphic design both requires some form of creativity in order for the product to stand out in the market and generate sales. Another reason why this position appealed to me is that, I enjoy graphic design as I have created graphics for my gaming applications before and I have enjoyed the process of creating something from scratch. I believe that jobs that require creativity and critical thinking would not be boring and dull and therefore would be the ideal job for me. </p>
    
    <p> This position has a number of skills and experience required such as a degree in Marketing or similar field, numerous years of experience in digital marketing and graphic design, strong knowledge of Shopify, and strong knowledge of Facebook advertising. This company needs an individual with skills that are able to build and promote their brand through the use of IT related tools such as Shopify, Facebook advertisements and graphic design.</p>
    
    <p> There are certain skills and experience that I have already acquired prior to this such as strong knowledge of Shopify. I have already developed an e-commerce Squarespace website which is currently up and running. Squarespace and Shopify are similar in terms of both of them being an e-commerce online store builder. As for the experience in graphic designing, I have strong knowledge in graphic designing applications such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator as I have used both of the applications to create graphics for my iOS app as well as for my e-commerce website. In my opinion, I believe I have strong knowledge of Facebook advertising and Instagram as I had use both of them to promote my e-commerce website to generate more sales. </p>
    
    <p> However, other skills and experience that I have not possess yet is a degree in Marketing or similar field, numerous years of experience in digital marketing and working with other e-commerce brands. Nevertheless, I will be graduating with a business degree next year. In terms of having years of experience in working with other brands, I would perhaps join a smaller scale advertising firm to gain experience and exposure on how they promote and advertise their brands. I could use the experience I have gained to further increase my knowledge in the marketing field. Therefore, I will be able to qualify for this position with the required set of skills. </p>

    <h2> Project Ideas </h2>
    
    <h3> Overview </h3>
    
    <p> My project idea would be to develop an easier workflow method and an application for the interior design company. The workflow would shorten the process of providing the interior design to prospective customers and the application is to generate a quotation estimate and billing system. This project workflow will help the interior designers to use 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR) to showcase their designs and when the interior design is approved, the application will then generate the quotation estimate from the 3D assets used in the Virtual Reality. </p>
    
    <h3> Motivation </h3>
    
    <p> I believe that this project would be interesting as it is very different and disruptive to the process of the interior designing workflow. This project would help interior designers to shorten their entire design workflow and also enhance their designs through the use of virtual reality, where this technology is still relatively new. Using 360-degree virtual reality technology, the interior designer can help the prospective client to view their approved interior design virtually in 360-degrees by using a head mount display such as the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive. Furthermore, by using the virtual reality technology, the clients can experience the interior more accurate and immersive as compared to the traditional way of presenting the interior design visual. With this method, it will also assist the client to quickly make their decision and the quotation estimate can be generated immediately for the client to the approve. </p>
 
    <h3> Description </h3>
    
    <p> This workflow and application is to help interior designers create design and generate quotation estimate as well as a billing system of the interior design with ease. From there, the interior designer will use the 3D software and Unity to produce a virtual reality of the design for the client. The client would decide whether the interior design is suitable. The application would then generate the quotation estimate based on the approved interior design. In this interactive walkthrough, it allows the client to be immersed into the interior of the house as if they are physically there. </p>
    <p> The process starts out when the client approaches the Interior Design company to design and renovate their house. The interior designer would then obtain the floor plan of the house from the owner.  With the floor plan, the designer would use a 3D software like 3Ds Max or Rhino to create and build the interior design into a 3D perspective. The 3D project files are then imported into Unity to create a 360-degree virtual reality in a photorealistic view. This 360 virtual reality will then be presented to the prospective client to view. Changes can be made instantaneously for the client to view again. This way, Unity can help the interior design company to shorten the process of designing and viewing the visual as compared to the traditional way of how the interior design company work. </p>
    <p> The advantage of using virtual reality is that the designer can guide the client to “walkthrough” the house interactively and to see the interior design in 360-degrees. The client can have an immersive view of the new interior design of the house by wearing the Head Mount Display from Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. They can interact with the surroundings of the interior and physically feel that as though they are walking in their new designed home. </p>
    <p> Lastly, my application would extract the interior assets from Unity to generate a quotation estimate for the client. Once the client approves on the agreed quotation, the application will produce an invoice. </p>
    
    <h3> Tools and Technology </h3>
    
    <p> There are certain software and hardware required for the development of the workflow and application. The software required are 3D Studios Max or 3D Rhino for building and modelling 3D assets as well as creating the texture and lighting of the scene. Unity is a Game Engine software, which is used to create 3D scene and animations for previewing in real-time. As for the hardware, a powerful PC is needed to preview the 3D interior design of the house in real-time. Furthermore, a 360 virtual reality system like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive for previewing the design in 360 virtual environment is needed. </p>
    
    <h3> Skills Required </h3>
    
    <p> An experience designer with strong knowledge of 3D software and a skilled programmer are needed to execute this workflow and the application. The designer and the programmer must have in-depth knowledge of Unity as well as being fluent in 3D animation and design software like 3Ds Max or Rhino. Further more, the programmer needs to know C++ as well as C# to develop the programming script in Unity. </p>
    <p> The programmer as well as the designer must also have in depth knowledge of hardware like PC and VR headsets to avoid any crash when working and presenting the interior design visuals to the clients. It is not easy to find the necessary components to develop this application. As VR technology is still new, acquiring the software and hardware can be expensive. The knowledge on training on how to used the VR are limited and employing experience staffs to handle the VR hardware are hard to find. There is shortage of experienced programmers with good knowledge in C++ and C# and they are also expensive to employ.</p>
 
    <h3> Outcome </h3>
    
    <p> If the project is successful, the problem that the interior design company face of presenting their design and providing an immediate quotation estimate can be solved. With my new workflow method and application, it would be more efficient, cost effective and innovative for the interior design company to use. </p>
    <p> Further more, it would speed up the entire process from designing, presenting and rendering in real-time, plus immediate quotation and billing. This application would definitely have an impact on sales, as it would provide the client with an immersive virtual walkthrough and letting them have a clearer ‘picture’ of how the house/room looks like. </p>
