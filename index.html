    <h2> Personal Information </h2>
    <p> Welcome to my profile! My name is Seah Soon Kitz (s3665432) and you can contact me through my email at Nickseah0921@gmail.com. I am a Malaysian Chinese who grew up in Malaysia, from where I am from, we have a diversity of cultures as Malaysia is a multi-racial country consisting of Chinese, Malays and Indians. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Business Management at RMIT University. I am able to speak four languages which are English, Malay, Chinese and Cantonese, it is a norm in my country to speak that many languages because there are many different races in Malaysia. A fun fact about myself is that I play the electric guitar, I have been playing the instrument for about 8 years now and I am in Grade 8 for the electric guitar exams. </p>
