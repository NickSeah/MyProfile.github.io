    <h1> My Profile </h1>
    <h2> Personal Information </h2>
    <p> Welcome to my profile! My name is Seah Soon Kitz (s3665432) and you can contact me through my email at Nickseah0921@gmail.com. I am a Malaysian Chinese who grew up in Malaysia, from where I am from, we have a diversity of cultures as Malaysia is a multi-racial country consisting of Chinese, Malays and Indians. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Business Management at RMIT University. I am able to speak four languages which are English, Malay, Chinese and Cantonese, it is a norm in my country to speak that many languages because there are many different races in Malaysia. A fun fact about myself is that I play the electric guitar, I have been playing the instrument for about 8 years now and I am in Grade 8 for the electric guitar exams. </p>  
    <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
    <p> What I find most interesting about IT is that how by integrating information technology into society, it can benefit and improve our everyday lives. For example, with Uber, any one is able to get a ride at any time and anywhere at their convenience through an application in their phone. My interest in IT started when I was developing gaming applications for the iOS at 14 years old. I have made around 6 games for the iPhone and iPad platform and made a good enough pocket money for myself. It was my father who persuaded me to start developing iOS applications as it was a growing trend back in the day. During that time, nobody taught me how to develop applications but rather I taught myself how to do so by watching many YouTube tutorials. It was a troublesome process but it was worth in the end as I was featured in our national newspaper for developing iOS applications. </p>
    
    <p> I chose to come to RMIT because it was recommended by my cousin who previously studied Finance at RMIT. He suggested that RMIT is an overall good university to further my studies in the Bachelor of Business. Other reasons I chose to come to RMIT is that it is convenient in terms of the short walking distance from where I live; this allows me to be on time for lectures and tutorials, and also the fact that the library is nearby for me to work on assignments or to study. </p>
    
    <p> In taking up the Bachelor of Business Management, I expect to further my knowledge in the field of business as I have to take over my parentsâ€™ advertising firm some time in the future. By taking up this course, I am hoping to learn how to run a business efficiently, how to deal and interact with my employees, how to apply the theories I have learned into real-world situations, and so on. </p>
